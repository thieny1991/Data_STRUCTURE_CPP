Here, foo is a pointer, and thus, the first element pointed to by foo can be accessed either with the expression foo[0] or the expression *foo (both are equivalent). The second element can be accessed either with foo[1] or *(foo+1), and so on...There is a substantial difference between declaring a normal array and allocating dynamic memory for a block of memory using new. The most important difference is that the size of a regular array needs to be a constant expression, and thus its size has to be determined at the moment of designing the program, before it is run, whereas the dynamic memory allocation performed by new allows to assign memory during runtime using any variable value as size.The dynamic memory requested by our program is allocated by the system from the memory heap. However, computer memory is a limited resource, and it can be exhausted. Therefore, there are no guarantees that all requests to allocate memory using operator new are going to be granted by the system. 

People were hoping you would work this out for yourself.A float is typically 4 (or 8) bytes. Let's assume 4.So 100000000 floats is 400000000 bytes. About 400 Megabytes.You're trying to create 100000000 arrays of this size, so you're trying to allocate 100000000 * 400 Megabytes, which is about 40000000 Gigabytes.See if you can find out how much memory your PC has, and see if you can spot a problem with trying to use 40000000 Gigabytes of memory.
